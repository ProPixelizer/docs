ProPixelizer's Render Feature adds rendering instructions and passes that are required for ProPixelizer to work.
The settings provide additional controls to tweak ProPixelizer to your needs, as described below:

### Pixelization

These properties configure the methods ProPixelizer uses to pixelate the scene.

- `Use Pixel Expansion`: allows pixelated objects to move with apparent sub-pixel motion relative to one another, without pixel creep. I created the method specifically for ProPixelizer, and an overview of how it works can be found here, under Attempt 3. It requires an additional post-process shader to be applied to the scene, but the smooth sub-pixel motion can make certain games feel more responsive.

### Outline Detection Controls

These properties configure properties of the outline and edge detection shaders.

- `Use Depth Testing for ID Outlines`: when enabled, outlines will only be drawn for edge pixels that are in front of their neighbors. This helps achieve the feel of a hand-drawn sprite, for which the outline would not change depending on the geometry in front of it. A comparison of the two settings is shown in the image here; take particular notice of the darker outline drawn over the vehicle inside the red box when Depth Test is off. The `Depth Test Threshold` can be adjusted to make ProPixelizer more or less sensitive to depth testing of ID outlines.
- `Use Normals For Edge Detection`: enables detection of edges (creases and ridges) using the scene normals. The `Normal Edge Detection Threshold` can be adjusted to change the sensitivity of the edge detection kernel.
- `Use Depth Testing for Edge Outlines`: controls whether depth testing should also be used for edges, enabling correct edge detection of objects like staircases.

### Editor Scene Tab

- `Editor Pixel Expansion`: when false, disables pixel expansion in the Editor's Scene tab only.

### Debugging

- `Generate Warnings`: allows you to disable warnings generated by ProPixelizer.
