The ProPixelizer package includes a number of things to achieve perfect pixelisation in your game.

- A [ProPixelizerUberShader](@/technical/ubershader/index.md) which provides control over pixelisation, color grading, outlines, cel shading and more.
- A [ShaderGraph SubTarget](@/usage/shadergraph/index.md) and examples if you want to create your own shaders.
- The [ProPixelizerCamera](@/usage/camera_setup/index.md) MonoBehavior for controlling ProPixelizer's pixelisation.
- Easy methods to [Remove Pixel Creep](@/usage/eliminate_pixel_creep/index.md) to create crisp looking 3D pixel art.
- Custom tools for creating your own [dither patterns and color palettes](@/usage/palette_tools/index.md), and [stepped animations](@/usage/stepped_animation/index.md).
