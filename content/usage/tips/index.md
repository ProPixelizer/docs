Below are a collection of tips to bear in mind when using ProPixelizer:

- Try to avoid small features in geometry that are less than a pixel in size - otherwise they can flicker in and out of visibility. Low poly assets, like those produced by Synty, work well because they do not have small details present.
- ProPixelizer's cel shading looks much better if you import low poly models with 'smooth normals', because it will allow color bands to appear across each face.
- Old school sprite art typically only has a few different viewing angles; snap the angles of your objects to achieve the same feel.
- Reduce the number of keyframes in animation and use 'constant' interpolation to give it a stepped feel, as if flicking through pages of a sprite sheet.
- When using Color Grading, it helps to create your assets while targeting a particular color palette. There are significant differences between the various old-school color palettes. GameBoy is monochrome, for instance, while PAL is dark and grungy.
- Remember that you can also do neat things not normally seen in pixel art games, such as depth-of-field post processing, procedural animations, etc.
