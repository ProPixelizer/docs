Find your Render Pipeline Asset(s)&nbsp;\nUniversal Render Pipeline stores your project's graphical configuration in a Render Pipeline Asset.\nThese assets are commonly stored in Assets/Settings.\nPlease note that your project very likely has multiple Render Pipeline Assets, and different platforms can use different Render Pipeline Assets.\n\nAt the top of Project Settings -&gt; Graphics, the Default Render Pipeline defines the default asset.\nThe chart at the top of Project Settings -&gt; Quality shows different Levels and the platforms that use them. Different platforms can define different render pipeline assets here. This is a common source of confusion! If your build looks different to editor, they probably have different Render Pipeline Assets.\n\n\n3. Configure your Render Pipeline Asset(s)&nbsp;\nYou can now add ProPixelizer to each Render Pipeline Asset that you are using.\n\nMake sure that anti-aliasing is disabled on each Render Pipeline Asset.\n\n\n\nSelect the renderer. Make sure that Depth Priming is disabled, and then add ProPixelizer's render feature to the render feature list.\n\n\nUpgrading from an older version&nbsp;\nIf your project is already using a previous version of ProPixelizer which was imported into your Project's Assets folder, please delete this old version first and then import the new version using the Unity Package Manager. The new version will be installed to Packages/ProPixelizer.\nProPixelizer uses the same .meta files for all assets and source files between versions and so your project will automatically use the updated scripts, Monobehaviors and assets from the new package version. For more detailed update notes and version history, see the changelog and update guide.\nCheck out the examples!&nbsp;\nYou have now configured your project for ProPixelizer.\nThe example scenes show you lots of interesting things you can do with ProPixelizer, and showcase various features of the plugin, so I recommend taking a look!\nI hope you enjoy using ProPixelizer.

Coupled with a ProPixelizer Camera this can be used to eliminate pixel creep. Snapping of object view angles is also supported, allowing you to easily create the look of hand drawn pixel art which typically restricts the number of view directions. The original positions and angles are restored after camera rendering is complete.\n\nSnapping&nbsp;\n\nSnap Position: enables or disables snapping of the object's position.\nSnap Euler Angles: enables or disables snapping of the object's rotation. A number of different strategies are available:\n\nWorld Space Rotation: the euler angles describing the rotation of the object in world space are snapped to the desired Angle Resolution.\nCamera Space Y: the euler angles describing the rotation of the object are snapped in world space for x and z, and camera space for the Y-axis. For a camera that rotates freely around the y-axis, this will allow objects to appear with a restricted number of view directions, as shown in the gif below.\n\n\n\n\nPixel Alignment&nbsp;\n\nAlign Pixel Grid: whether to align an object's macropixels to the given  Pixel Grid Reference when applying snapping. This can be used to prevent sub-pixel relative motion between two objects (for more detail on aligning pixel grids, see here). This setting is only required if you are using pixel expansion\nAlignment Pixel Size: The size of the macropixel used when snapping an object's position with respect to the given Pixel Grid Reference. Normally, you want this property to be equal to your ProPixelizer material pixel size. When Get Pixel Size From Material is enabled, this property will be set automatically  by getting the Pixel size property from a ProPixelizer material on the object.\n\nMaterials&nbsp;\n\nConfigure Children: When true, sets the material keywords required for snapping on all child meshes of this transform.\n\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/technical/objectrendersnapable/","title":"Object Render Snapable"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/technical/propixelizer-camera/":{"body":"The ProPixelizerCamera is a MonoBehavior that should be added to camera objects in your scene. It provides additional control over ProPixelizer's rendering, and performs the position and angle snapping required to eliminate creep. There are a number of properties available:\n\nPixelization&nbsp;\nThe Pixelization Filter controls what objects should be pixelated, allowing you to switch between 'hybrid' styles (where only some objects are pixelated) and full screen pixelization.\n\nFull Scene pixelates the entire scene.\nOnly ProPixelizer will only pixelate ProPixelizer materials and shaders, including ones you create using the ShaderGraph SubTarget.\n\nAdditionally, when operating with Full Scene additional options are available:\n\nUse Pixel Art Upscaling will enable or disable use of a pixel art upscaling filter when blitting the low-res target back to the screen. This can be useful to reduce shimmer artefacts\nYou may choose between a two methods of rendering the low-res target. The Virtual camera path is faster, and works by redirecting URP's opaque, transparents and skybox calls into the ProPixelizer low-res target, but may have compatibility issues with other assets. The Subcamera path uses a second camera to render the scene at low resolution; it is more widely compatible, but less performant.\n\nPixel size&nbsp;\nThere are several Modes available to determine the pixelization of the low resolution target.\n\nWorld Space Pixel Size allows you to specify the size of a low-res pixel in world units. This size will be maintained for different camera orthographic sizes and screen resolutions. This is useful for your objects, characters and world to maintain the same apparent pixelization as you freely pan and zoom the view around them.\nFixed Downscaling Ratio defines the low-res target resolution as a fixed multiple of the screen resolution. Note that changes in screen resolution will change the apparent pixelisation of the object.\nFixed Target Resolution allows you to define a fixed height of the low-res target. This is useful if emulating a specific hardware, for example '320p'.\n\nFullscreen options&nbsp;\nThe Fullscreen Color Grading LUT allows you to apply color grading and dithering to the entire scene by specifying a color palette LUT. You can use ProPixelizer to create your own. These properties can be specified for individual cameras. Note: It's still my firm belief that dithering looks better when applied at the object level, so that the dither pattern can move with the object. ProPixelizer now supports both of these approaches, so don't take my word for it - decide for yourself what you like best!\nRender Feature overrides&nbsp;\nThese settings can override specific properties of the render feature for each camera, for example to disable ProPixelizer or pixel expansion for a camera.\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/technical/propixelizer-camera/","title":"ProPixelizer Camera"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/technical/render-feature/":{"body":"ProPixelizer's Render Feature adds rendering instructions and passes that are required for ProPixelizer to work.\nThe settings provide additional controls to tweak ProPixelizer to your needs, as described below:\n\nPixelization&nbsp;\nThese properties configure the methods ProPixelizer uses to pixelate the scene.\n\nUse Pixel Expansion: allows pixelated objects to move with apparent sub-pixel motion relative to one another, without pixel creep.

The shader itself is authored in ShaderGraph using the ProPixelizer SubTarget, located at ProPixelizer/ShaderGraph/ProPixelizerUberShader.shadergraph. Don't forget that you can copy and modify this shadergraph to tweak the shader to your own requirements!\nNote: Previous versions of ProPixelizer featured the PixelizedWithOutline shader. The Uber shader is a drop-in replacement shader, which has all the features of the old shader while adding many more, eg. Forward+ support, Hybrid renderer support, GPU Instancing. It is recommended to upgrade your PixelizedWithOutline materials to the Uber shader.\n\nProPixelizer Properties&nbsp;\nThese properties are present for all ProPixelizer SubTarget materials, and control aspects of the cel shading and pixelisation.\nAppearance:\n\nUse Color Grading: when enabled, the material applies the given Palette look-up-table, which allows you to apply color palettes and dithering to your object. The Palette texture property is a texture look-up table (LUT) used for the color grading. A number of LUTs to emulate well-known devices (eg NES, PAL, GameBoy) are shipped with ProPixelizer, and ProPixelizer provides tools to create your own. The LUT can also include color dither patterns as demonstrated here.\nUse Dithering: toggles whether partial alpha (in the range 0 to 1) should be ignored or drawn as dithered transparency.\n\nLighting:\n\nLighting Ramp: a texture ramp used for cell shading, which helps give a pixel-art aesthetic. When rendering the object, the value of the lit HSV color is used as a coordinate to sample the lighting ramp.\nAmbient Light: fine control over ambient lighting conditions. The Constant Weight slider can be used to adjust between only using scene ambient light (0), which uses spherical harmonics, and only using the Constant Color (1). Some hand-drawn pixel art styles implicitly assume a fixed constant ambient light, so this option provides an ability to fine tune between those styles and 3D pixel art where ambient light can be included in the object shading.\n\nPixelization\n\nPixel size: Controls the size of one 'macropixel' when Use Pixel Expansion is enabled (see more information here).\n\nOutline\n\nID: A unique integer in the range (0, 255). Outlines are drawn when pixels have an ID different to those around them. If two objects should have outlines when they meet, give them different IDs (eg, two enemies). If they should not have outlines (eg, a character and their equipment), give them the same ID.\n\nSurface Inputs&nbsp;\nThese closely match similar properties from the URP Lit shader.\n\nAlbedo texture and Color: define the base color of the model before lighting calculations, and default to white if unassigned. The alpha channel of the Albedo texture is used for alpha clipping.\nNormal Map: an optional normal map to add shading detail to the model. In general, I find that cel shading in pixel art tends to work best without normal maps and using smooth shading on models, but there are some situations (eg. scenery) where normal maps can be useful.\nEmission texture and Emission Color: provide unlit colors for your material. Think laser beams, red eyes on skeletons, etc - anything you want to be bright even when in darkness. The color is an HDR property to support bloom post processing.\nDiffuseVertexColorWeight and EmissiveVertexColorWeight: these sliders control whether any vertex colors in the mesh should be used to additionally tint the lit and unlit colors of the mesh. Unity's particle system uses vertex color for 'per particle' coloring. Some Synty models have black vertex colors on some mesh areas.\nAlpha Clip Threshold: the minimum alpha value of the Albedo and Color required to draw parts of the mesh.\n\nOutline properties, for more information on available outline types see the outline section.\n\nOutline Color: the color to use for the silhouette outline, with outline strength controlled by the alpha the alpha value; alpha values of 0 can be used for invisible outlines, 1.0 can be used for block color, and fractions to blend with the unoutlined color.\nEdge Highlight: lightens or darken edges detected by inspection of scene normals. Requires that 'Use Normals For Edge Detection' is enabled on the Render Feature. Color values less than 0.5 will darken edges, color values above 0.5 will lighten edges, and values of 0.5 will make no difference.\nEdge Bevel Weight: Controls the strength of edge bevelling, which changes the mesh normals along detected edges to enable light-reactive edges.\n\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/technical/ubershader/","title":"Uber Shader"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/tips_and_tricks/":{"body":"","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/tips_and_tricks/","title":"Tips and tricks"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/tips_and_tricks/artefacts/":{"body":"Pixel art is a popular art style, but also highly perfectionist! Even a few small errors can greatly degrade the appearance of good pixel art. Here, I describe some common artefacts that occur when using 3d objects to create pixel art, and what you can do to fix them.\nCreep&nbsp;\nCreep is the most well-known 3D pixel art artefact. Visually, the object appears to change shape and form as it moves relative to the camera. This can occur due to object movement, or for stationary objects because the camera is moving. The underlying cause is because the object is rasterized differently to the screen each time, resulting in an inconsistent set of pixels being drawn, which is most commonly due to sub-pixel motion of the object. The result is a visually distracting artefact, which is particularly noticeable in outlines.\n\n\nPixel creep: The object's pixel composition appears to change, creating a visually distracting artefact.\n\nHow to fix it?&nbsp;\nProPixelizer provides functionality for correctly handling sub-pixel relative object motion as described in this section.\n\n\nNo creep: Pixel creep removed through snapping of relative object motion.\n\nJaggies&nbsp;\nA hallmark of pixel art is clean edges, with straight lines parallel to the horizontal axes creating perfect 'staircases' of 2x1 pixels. An interrupted staircase is usually called a jaggie.\n\n\nJaggies: An otherwise perfect 2x1 edge staircase is interrupted by the presence of a 1x1 pixel.\n\nHow to fix it?&nbsp;\n\n\nFixed: Fixing the camera rotation aligns the edges of the object correctly to allow perfect staircases to be rendered. ProPixelizer's edge detection kernels are optimised to give you correct staircases.\n\nCheck that you are using the correct projection for your orthographic camera. The easiest way to debug this is to place a cube in the scene directly in front of your camera. The camera should be first rotated 45 degrees about the vertical, and then tilted 30 degrees below horizontal (for example, use a rotation value in the transform of (30, 45, 0), as in the ProPixelizer example scenes). The edges of your cube will then be pointing in a direction with a ratio of 2 pixels up/down for every one pixel across.\nJaggies can also result when pixelating by rendering to a low-resolution target. If the target is upscaled onto the screen by a non-integer multiple, aliasing of the low-resolution target will occur, causing rows and columns of pixels to be of different sizes and interrupting the staircase. ProPixelizer provides a pixel art antialiasing filter to mitigate this effect. It also provides useful functions to set your low-res target resolution to an integer ratio of the screen resolution.\nMoire pattern&nbsp;\nA Moiré pattern is an optical illusion that is formed when two repeating patterns of different scale overlap. The mixture of these two patterns produces a third pattern, which is often unintended and can be visually distracting. These patterns are the reasons why pinstripe clothes and other textiles are not worn on television!\nThe general concept is shown below. In the first row we see a pattern consisting of bars, 6 pixels wide and repeating every 12 pixels. In the second row, we see bars 7 pixels wide and repeating every 14 pixels. The third row shows what happens when these patterns are overlaid; a new periodic pattern can be seen, with the repeating element shown by the red bar. The periodicity is equal to the lowest common multiple of the two original patterns, which in this case is 84 pixels.\n\n\nMoire patterns: The periodic patterns in the top two rows combine to produce a Moiré pattern shown in the third row.\n\nSo what is the issue? Well, periodic patterns appear in pixel art more often than you may at first realise! Ordered dithering - in which two different colors are interleaved to approximate a third - is a popular technique and a hallmark of certain pixel art styles.\nA Moiré pattern can occur when dithered objects are drawn one on texture, which is then scaled and displayed on the screen at non-integer zoom. For 3D pixel art, this situation can occur when the pixelated, low resolution target is rescaled and presented on the screen. Movement of the objects or camera can cause these patterns to shimmer in a very distracting manner.\n\n\nMoire patterns in a pixel art scene: Rescaling the low-resolution render to match the screen has resulted in a visually distracting Moiré pattern. The red box highlights one element of the repeating pattern.\n\nThe issue is particularly bad whenever\nHow to fix it?&nbsp;\nThere are two different approaches you can take to fix this:\nOption 1: Make sure your pixels are large and take up a large number of screen pixels. This doesn't technically fix the pattern, but it makes it less perceptible. However, this fix is not appropriate for all styles. In ProPixelizer you can do this by either increasing the Pixel Size on the ProPixelizer Camera monobehavior when using World Space Pixel Size mode, or by reducing the camera's orthographic size to reduce the camera field of view. However, this approach is only appropriate for certain pixel art styles.\n\n\nAbove: Moire patterns are less visible when the pixel sizes are large.\n\nOption 2: Make sure your pixels are an integer number of screen pixels. This approach completely eradicates the Moiré pattern by allowing the low resolution texture to perfectly scale into the screen texture without any interpolation or aliasing artefacts.\nShimmer&nbsp;\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/tips_and_tricks/artefacts/","title":"Common artefacts"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/":{"body":"","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/","title":"Using ProPixelizer"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/camera-setup/":{"body":"","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/camera-setup/","title":"Camera setup"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/eliminate-pixel-creep/":{"body":"Pixel creep is a problem that occurs frequently when rendering 3D objects as pixel art - the object appears to shimmer as it moves across the screen. An example can be seen in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO8O5tY-wZI . The creep occurs because both the number of pixels that an object occludes, and the alignment of the object with respect to the pixels, changes as it moves across the screen.\nPixel creep can be removed by aligning objects to the pixels of the screen before rendering them. Pixel creep can only ever be solved for orthographic projections; in a perspective projection, the object size changes as it moves on the screen.\nFor orthographic projections, ProPixelizer provides functionality to handle this for you, through two MonoBehaviours:\n\n\nThe ProPixelizer Camera MonoBehaviour, which is attached to your camera.\n\n\nThe ObjectRenderSnapable MonoBehaviour, attached to moving objects that you are rendering.\n\n\nThese MonoBehaviours will snap object positions before rendering and restore them afterwards. The implementation respects transform hierarchies.\nSnapping angles&nbsp;\nThe ObjectRenderSnapable MonoBehaviour can also snap the angles of objects being rendered. Set ShouldSnapAngles to true if object angles should also be snapped, by the desired Angle Resolution. If you have nested transformations (eg for equipment), I recommend you only do this on the root transform.\nAligning pixel grids&nbsp;\nThe ObjectRenderSnapable MonoBehaviour also provides a way to align the pixel grids of child objects to their root transform. This is useful for things like equipment - you have different meshes but want the complete object to look like one sprite. Set the property Align Pixel Grid to true to cause the object's pixel grid to be aligned with the Pixel Grid Reference transform, or the root transform of the heirachy if this property is none.\nAn example is given in the picture on the left, showing how the blue/green shield looks when it is and is not aligned to the pixels of the root transform. Look closely within the circles - on the unaligned you should be able to see the slightly 1 pixel misalignment of the two objects with 3x3 pixelsizes.\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/eliminate-pixel-creep/","title":"Eliminating Pixel Creep"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/faq/":{"body":"My object looks like a bunch of dots?&nbsp;\n\nProblem: Pixelated objects appear as a bunch of dots when rendered, as if dithered.\n\nThe solution: The Pixelisation Feature needs to be added to the Render Features of the Scriptable Render Pipeline - see 'Setting Up The Render Pipeline' under 'Getting Started', above.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in why it looks like this, you can find the answer in this article which describes how ProPixelizer works. The method used for ProPixelizer is described under Attempt #3; objects are first drawn as a dithered matrix of dots, then the post process fills the surrounding screen pixels to produce the final pixelated image.\nNote that ProPixelizer also implements dithering for transparency when the materials alpha is not 1 - this applies to both texture and color. If the example scenes are rendering correctly, but your assets are appearing dithered, check that the alpha of your material color and textures.\nProPixelizer on WebGL&nbsp;\nProPixelizer supports webGL and is tested on all major browsers (Firefox, Chrome).\nIf you are finding that ProPixelizer is not working on WebGL, check that you have the ProPixelizer Render Feature added to your render pipeline asset. By default, Unity will use different render pipeline assets for PC platforms and webGL; if it works in editor and not in build, it's extremely likely that your editor is using a different render pipeline to build.\n\nThe shaders are coming up pink!&nbsp;\nThis means that the ProPixelizer shaders have not been correctly compiled by Unity. There are typically two possible reasons this occurs:\n\nIn some cases, Unity Package Manager will add the files to the project but not import them correctly.\n\nSolution: In the project's Asset Browser locate the Packages/ProPixelizer folder and click 'Reimport'.\n\n\nIn earlier versions of ProPixelizer, the shader graph fails to compile because it is generating too many variants, reporting the error: Error in Graph at Assets/ProPixelizer/ShaderGraph/Pixelised.shadergraph at node PBR Master: Graph is generating too many variants. Either delete Keywords, reduce Keyword variants or increase the Shader Variant Limit in Preferences &gt; Shader Graph.\n\nSolution: This can be fixed by increasing the Shader Variant Limit using Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Shader Graph, e.g. changing from the default 128 to 256.

If you have an object with multiple mesh components - for example a character with equipment - then you may wish to assign the same ID to each material and align the meshes to ensure a silhouette is drawn around the entire character.\nWhen two objects overlap, ProPixelizer performs additional depth testing of the ID-based outlines to make sure that outlines are only drawn for foreground objects; this prevents incorrect outlines from appearing on visible edge of the background object.\n\n\nDepth tested outlines: ProPixelizer performs depth-testing of silhouette outlines to ensure correct outlines when objects overlap.\n\nThe Uber Shader contains an OutlineColor property for silhouette outline control, where the alpha value controls the silhouette outline strength (and can be set to 0 to disable the outline entirely). The ProPixelizer SubTarget for shader graph provides the ProPixelizer Outline color input node, which grants per-pixel outline control and can be used to create custom outline styles and animated outline effects.\nEdges&nbsp;\nProPixelizer provides two methods for drawing edge lines on your models.\nThese methods work by analysing the normals rendered to the screen to identify ridges and folds in the mesh.\nThe Normal Edge Detection Threshold on the ProPixelizer Render Feature adjusts how sensitive the edge detection algorithm is, and the value can be tuned to detect more or less edges across the scene.\nAdditionally, ProPixelizer can perform edge detection by testing the scene depth in addition to screen normals, as shown in the image, when Use Depth Testing For Edge Outlines is enabled on the Render Feature.\n\n\nDepth tested edges: Edges are detected through analysis of both scene normals and depth. For example, the edges within the circle on the top surface all have the same surface normals (directly up), but edges are detected due to changes in the scene depth.\n\n\n\nAbove: A comparison of bevel and edge highlights.\n\nBevel Edges&nbsp;\nBevel edges create 1 pixel wide edges where the normals are the average of the faces surrounding the edge. The result is a line which is light reactive, responding to illumination as if the edge were bevelled. For edges on the rear side of an object, ProPixelizer will also fold the edge normals away from the camera, allowing the rear edges to interact with light sources behind the object to create a rim light effect.\nIn the Uber Shader the normal blending for edge bevelling is controlled by the Edge Bevel Weight property, while in the ProPixelizer SubTarget for ShaderGraph the corresponding input node is ProPixelizer Bevel Weight.\nEdge Highlights&nbsp;\nThe edge highlight adds or subtracts a constant color to an object's detected edges to brighten or darken them.\nIn the Uber Shader the color is controlled by the Edge Highlight Color property, and in the ProPixelizer SubTarget for ShaderGraph the corresponding input node is ProPixelizer Edge Highlight.\nColor values less than 0.5 will darken edges, color values above 0.5 will lighten edges, and values of 0.5 will make no difference.\nThe alpha value can be used to control the edge highlight strength.\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/outlines/","title":"Edges and Outlines"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/overview/":{"body":"The ProPixelizer package includes a number of things to achieve perfect pixelisation in your game.\n\nA ProPixelizerUberShader which provides control over pixelisation, color grading, outlines, cel shading and more.\nA ShaderGraph SubTarget and examples if you want to create your own shaders.\nThe ProPixelizerCamera MonoBehavior for controlling ProPixelizer's pixelisation.\nMultiple pixelization methods, ranging from fully pixelated to hybrid/selectively-pixelated scenes.\nEasy methods to Remove Pixel Creep to create crisp looking 3D pixel art.\nDifferent types of edges and outlines to support a variety of different pixel art styles.\nCustom tools for creating your own dither patterns and color palettes, and stepped animations.\n\nIf you need help please do contact me for support:\n\nvia email, elliot.bentine@gmail.com\nvia discord DMs (username: elliotb256)\nvia the ProPixelizer server (click the icon in the nav bar to join).\n\nI hope you enjoy using ProPixelizer, and I'm always very pleased to hear what you make with it!\nCheers!\nElliot\n\n\nAbove: An example scene created in ProPixelizer.\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/overview/","title":"Overview"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/palette-tools/":{"body":"Palettes and Dither Patterns&nbsp;\nMany old games used reduced color palettes, often due to hardware limitations!

Games sometimes employed dithering to emulate an increased color depth.\nProPixelizer gives you a set of tools to create reduced color palettes and dither patterns. Both are combined into a texture Look-Up Table (LUT) which is sampled when rendering the object to color grade with minimal overhead.\nDither patterns&nbsp;\nProPixelizer supports 4x4 dither patterns. You can design your own dither pattern by creating a dither pattern asset (Create -&gt; ProPixelizer -&gt; Dither Pattern). The editor will display a 4x4 grid of values, and a preview of how the dither pattern will appear for a smooth monochrome gradient.

Pixel art comes in a variety of styles, hammered out through decades of changing hardware limitations and favored aesthetics. In practical terms, a good pixelart package must be flexible enough to render a whole range of different styles, because everyone wants something slightly different.\nStarting from v2.0, ProPixelizer provides a number of different methods and options for controlling pixelization, as discussed below.\nLow-resolution Render Target&nbsp;\nThe most common technique used to pixelize 3D scenes is to render them at a resolution lower than the screen, then increase their scale using nearest/point filtering to retain 'crisp' pixels. There are numerous tutorials and assets that use this technique in Unity. In ProPixelizer v2.0, a low-resolution render target is used for some or all of the pixelation, depending on your settings.\nProPixelizer will automatically create and manage the low-resolution render target for you. The resolution of the low-resolution render target is controlled through the properties of the ProPixelizer Camera monobehavior. It can either be set to a fixed ratio of the screen resolution, a fixed resolution, or defined such that a single pixel has a specified size in world space units. In all cases the low-resolution render target's resolution cannot exceed the screen's resolution for performance reasons.\nProPixelizer will automatically handle sub-pixel camera motion for you: as your camera moves through the world, the low-resolution render target will move smoothly with respect to the screen resolution.\nLow-resolution filter options&nbsp;\nProPixelizer lets you choose how much of your scene should be pixelated. You may choose to have either the full scene rendered to the low-resolution render target, or just ProPixelizer materials. This allows you to create everything from 100% pixel art scenes to 'hybrid' scenes that combine polygons and pixelart.\nThis later 'hybrid' style is reminiscent of games from the 90s like Breath of Fire IV, Final Fantasy, and Populous: The Beginning where characters where often rendered as sprites and the background often rendered as low-poly 3d models.\n\n\nAbove: A scene from the playstation game 'Breath of Fire IV' demonstrating a hybrid style.\n\n\n\nAbove: A hybrid setup in ProPixelizer. The characters are drawn pixelated, while a low poly environment is used for the surroundings.\n\nPixel Expansion&nbsp;\nDespite being a popular method, using a low-resolution render target has a major drawback: In order to prevent pixel creep artefacts from occuring, objects must be snapped to the pixels of the low-resolution target. When the target is more pixelated, the object motion becomes more constrained. This has a negative effect on the 'user feel' in games that require precise feedback, such as action rpgs and arcade games - the motion becomes clunkier because small 'sub-pixel' increments are not possible.\n\n\nAbove: Creepless motion using a low-resolution render target. Individual objects must move in increments of the low-resolution render target.\n\nProPixelizer solves this problem using Pixel Expansion. I created this method specifically for ProPixelizer, and describe its implementation here, under attempt 3. This technique works by drawing objects as a dithered pattern, and then expanding these dots into larger pixels through a post process. The result is that a given level of pixelization can be achieved using a smaller low-resolution target pixel size, and thus smooth movement can be retained. The method also supports per-object pixel sizes.\n\n\nAbove: Creepless motion using a low-resolution render target and pixel expansion. Apparent sub-pixel motion between objects is possible because the low-resolution render target pixel size can be smaller while maintaining the same apparent level of pixelisation. Per-object pixel sizes are also supported.\n\nYou can enable or disable Pixel Expansion using the checkbox in the render feature.\nPerformance&nbsp;\nPixel Expansion requires an additional pass that is similar to an anti-aliasing pass; you can use it freely on PC and console, but be mindful on low-end mobile devices.\nSome performance guidelines for different platforms can be found below. Note that you can specify different render pipeline assets for different quality settings, so you can automatically build e.g. mobile or webGL with different ProPixelizer settings than PC or console.\n\nHighest performance (android, iOS, webGL)\n\nFull-screen pixelization filter, disable Use Pixel Expansion, use virtual camera.\n\n\nHighest fidelity (PC, consoles)\n\nEnable Use pixel expansion if smooth movement is desired.\n\n\n\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/pixelization/","title":"Pixelisation Controls"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/shadergraph/":{"body":"Do you want to make your own shaders using ProPixelizer? No problem! ProPixelizer v2.0 introduces the ProPixelizer SubTarget for ShaderGraph, which lets you author your own pixelated shaders easily within ShaderGraph. You use the SubTarget the same as a URP Lit master node; simply add your surface inputs, and ProPixelizer will handle all pixelisation, dithering, outlining, cel shading and color grading for you.\nFor more advanced users, the ProPixelizer SubTarget also supports:\n\nGPU Instancing\nthe Hybrid Renderer used by Unity's ECS\nCustom properties\n\nThe SubTarget also supports per-pixel outline colors; this lets you do cool things like animated dashed outlines, as shown in the examples below.\nUsing the SubTarget&nbsp;\nYou can configure a ShaderGraph to use the ProPixelizer SubTarget by using the option in the Graph Inspector dialogue from within the ShaderGraph editor.\n\nProPixelizer will automatically add the required material properties, rendering instructions and passes to your shader.\n\nWhen creating your own graphs, the only requirement is that you include the ProPixelizer SG Alpha node, as in the example below.\n\nExample: Uber Shader&nbsp;\nFor an example, let's take a look at the ProPixelizerUberShader, which is located at ProPixelizer/ShaderGraph.\n\nThere are two main calculations going on here to determine (i) a lit color, which will receive light; and (ii) an emission color, which is independent of light in the scene.\n\nThe lit color uses the DiffuseVertexcolorWeight float parameter to blend between either white or the model's Vertex color. The result is multiplied by the color property to tint it, and then multiplied again by the Albedo texture. This is fed into the Base color input of the SubTarget.\nThe emission color is similar. We use the EmissiveVertexcolorWeight float parameter to blend between white or the model's Vertex color. The result is multiplied by the Emissioncolor, and then multiplied by the Emission texture. This is fed into the Emission input of the SubTarget.\n\nExample: Animated dashed outline&nbsp;\nThis example can be found in the Example Assets, under ShaderGraph.\nAs mentioned above, the ProPixelizer SubTarget also gives you per pixel control over edges and outlines. In the following example, we use this to create an animated dashed outline - the sort you might have to indicate a unit is selected in an RTS, for instance.\n\nTo create the outline, we take the screen position x and y, multiply them by a constant (to control the line width) and add the results together to give a single number that increases from the bottom left to the top right of the screen. We add time to make this number scroll, and use modulo to wrap the increasing numbers over the range [0,1]. A step changes this sawtooth pattern into stripes, which we then use as the input to lerp between two colors for our outline. The final color is fed into the ProPixelizer Outline input of the SubTarget.\n\nNote that the screenshot above uses color grading, and so the outline color is coerced onto the closest matching color from the color palette. If color palette is disabled, the output looks like the below. Color palettes offer a really neat way to quickly change the look and feel of a project!\n\nExample: Prismatic outline&nbsp;\nLet's create a multi-colored outline:\n\nWe use the screen coordinates to sample a noise texture, and pass the resulting values into the red and green color channels to create a colorful noisy pattern. Then we plug this color into the ProPixelizer Outline color input of the SubTarget.\n\nPerhaps you could use this to highlight a particularly rare item in your game?\nExample: World-space 'chips' in bevel edges&nbsp;\nThis example can be found in the Example Assets, under ShaderGraph.\n\nNow let's imagine that we have some old stone ruins, and we want the blocks to be chipped and weathered. We could  model this directly in the 3D model, but that makes it difficult to rescale the features (and small features are hard to reliably render when using 3D to pixel art workflows). Furthermore, we want some variation between assets so that each block looks unique.\n\nWe first take the world space position and combine the x, y, z coordinates to create a UV coordinate that we can use to sample the Simple Noise and Voronoi nodes. Multiplying the results gives us a noisy pattern with hard edges that is spread across the world. We apply a step function to the result, creating faceted black and white areas:\n\nWe plug this chip pattern into the ProPixelizer Bevel Weight input; this enables the bevel when the chip pattern is white, and disables it where the chip pattern is black. This creates world-space chips in our otherwise perfect 1px bevel lines. We also dilute the chip pattern and direct it to the color node, so that strong weathering will produce a discoloration across the faces that will line up with the bevel chips.\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/shadergraph/","title":"ShaderGraph Support"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/stepped-animation/":{"body":"Traditional pixel-art games used hand-drawn sprite sheets, and characters were animated by changing which sprite was displayed - the result was like a 'flipbook', with a few well defined poses. For instance, the cycle for a run animation could be ~5 frames long. 3D animations, on the other hand, commonly interpolate between key frames to produce smooth movement.\nTo help users achieve a flipbook effect, ProPixelizer provides a utility for automatically converting animation clips into stepped versions. A copy of the animation clip is created, keyframes are decimated, and the interpolation is set to None. This utility allows you to use many standard animations (e.g. from the Asset Store) in a way that keeps the pixel art aesthetic.\nTo use these tools, create a Stepped Animation asset (Create -&gt; ProPixelizer -&gt; Stepped Animation). After configuring the asset, click 'generate' to create copies of the source clips.\n\nLastly, if you are using clips with anim trees, you should turn off the blending for the anim tree - otherwise changes of state will interpolate between frames, and break the flipbook feel.\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/stepped-animation/","title":"Stepped Animation Tools"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/tips/":{"body":"Below are a collection of tips to bear in mind when using ProPixelizer:\n\nTry to avoid small features in geometry that are less than a pixel in size - otherwise they can flicker in and out of visibility. Low poly assets, like those produced by Synty, work well because they do not have small details present.\nProPixelizer's cel shading looks much better if you import low poly models with 'smooth normals', because it will allow color bands to appear across each face.\nOld school sprite art typically only has a few different viewing angles; snap the angles of your objects to achieve the same feel.\nReduce the number of keyframes in animation and use 'constant' interpolation to give it a stepped feel, as if flicking through pages of a sprite sheet.\nWhen using Color Grading, it helps to create your assets while targeting a particular color palette. There are significant differences between the various old-school color palettes. GameBoy is monochrome, for instance, while PAL is dark and grungy.\nRemember that you can also do neat things not normally seen in pixel art games, such as depth-of-field post processing, procedural animations, etc.\n\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/usage/tips/","title":"General Tips"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/versions/":{"body":"","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/versions/","title":"Versions"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/versions/changelog/":{"body":"Version 2.0&nbsp;\n\nAdded Low-res render target mode.\nAdded Hybrid low-res render target mode.\nAdded Full screen pixelisation mode.\nAdded Full screen color grading option.\nAdded Full screen dither option.\nAdded depth testing to normal-derived edges (e.g. to reveal steps)\nAdded Automatic rescaling to preserve world-space pixel size when zooming.\nAdded Automatic rescaling to preserve world-space pixel size when changing screen resolution.\nAdded ProPixelizer SubTarget for ShaderGraph - use it like a lit shadergraph, all pixelisation/dithering/color grading/cel shading/outlines are handled for you.

A modal window will warn you that import failed if you do not. ProPixelizer has now moved to the Packages folder.\nVersion 2.0 adds a lot of new features, and much of the package has been rewritten. Despite this, you shouldn't need to make any changes to your project! I have maintained asset GUIDs, so Unity will automatically incorporate the new versions of any files into your project, even if they have been renamed.\nIf you were using the ProPixelizer Render Pipeline Asset, you will find it is now included in the package samples, and so you'll need to import the samples into your project to continue using it.\nThere are many new features. The sample scenes give different examples of these; they all contain readmes in the scene heirachy with detailed further information. I strongly recommend that you import these scenes and look through them to understand what ProPixelizer can now do.\nPixelizedWithOutline is now deprecated and you should use the UberShader as a replacement; it does all the same things, but supports additional functionality like the DOTS renderer and GPU instancing. If you want to update your materials, you can do this easily using a button on the material inspector.\nGiven the changes to the rendering API in Unity 6 (RenderGraph), I had to drop support for some of the legacy editors to focus efforts on newer features. This version drops support for 2020 and 2021, but maintains support for 2022 LTS. All previous versions of ProPixelizer are available on the ProPixelizer git repository, contact me if you would like access and I will gladly assist.\n\nUpdating to v1.8&nbsp;\n\nDithered transparency is now disabled by default, but can be enabled through a material keyword via the inspector.\n\nUpdating to v1.7&nbsp;\n\nYou must now use the single Appearance+Outline material (PixelizedWithOutline) - Appearance will no longer work.\nSource Buffer option has been removed - pixelization is now determined only using the ProPixelizer Metadata buffer for better support across the different platforms. The appearance material does not have the passes required to render to the ProPixelizer Metadata buffer (these are added by the PixelizedWithOutline shader).\nSome material properties have been named from randomized ShaderGraph strings into more meaningful names.\nAn automatic material updater has been added to fix both of the above issues. If your materials need to be updated, an update button will appear in inspector which will migrate your materials and properties to the PixelizedWithOutline shader.\nYou no longer need to add things to 'Always Included Shaders'.\n2019 is no longer supported, but both 2020 and 2021 now have LTS versions you can use instead. There is early support for 2022, but please bear in mind the URP API for this version is currently still changing frequently.\nMany of the updates can be automatically applied to your materials using the tool at Window/ProPixelizer/Update and Verify Materials. Please back up your project before using it, it will search through all materials looking for ProPixelizer materials to update.\n\nUpdating to v1.6&nbsp;\n\nThere are now some features of ProPixelizer which require the Outline pass to run. Use the Appearance+Outline material (which includes this pass), not the Appearance material. If you want to remove the outline, just set the outline alpha to zero.\nThere is now another material to add to the Always Include Shaders under Project Settings &gt; Graphics: Hidden/ProPixelizer/SRP/OutlineDetection. You can see the full list in the 'setting up the project' part of this guide.\n\nUpdating to v1.4&nbsp;\n\nI changed the name of some shader keywords to be consistent between outline and appearance materials. After you update, run the tool Window/ProPixelizer/Verify Materials to fix any broken materials in your project (this will update all materials to use the new keywords).\n\n","id":"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/versions/updating-from-prev/","title":"Updating from previous versions"},"https://propixelizer.github.io/docs/welcome/":{"body":"\nWelcome to ProPixelizer's documentation!\n\nFor setting up a new project, see the Quick Start guide.\nCheck out the examples for hands-on demos.\nFor a more detailed description of how to use the package, start with the overview.\nYou can also search the documentation using the icon in the top right.\n\nI hope you enjoy using ProPixelizer.
