# ProPixelizer Documentation

This is the source code for ProPixelizer's user guide and documentation, starting from v2.0. I found that the increasing complexity of the package meant it had outgrown the [google site](https://sites.google.com/view/propixelizer/user-guide) that previously hosted it.

The documentation here uses [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) to render a static site from markdown files. For anyone wanting to build the documentation themselves, the website can be locally hosted using:
```
zola serve
```
